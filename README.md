<strong>This game has been developed using HTML, CSS and javaScript</strong>, in order to practice and develop my skills in these languages.

Have you ever played rock-paper-scissors before? Are you tired of picking always the same three options? This is probably your game. Let's react! ✅

In this game you have differents reactions to beat your opponents, and you are probably wondering: Why are you always talking about reactions? What do you mean?

In order to fight you need to combine four main elements in pairs: ❄️ (Ice), 🔥 (Fire), 🍃 (Wind), and ⚙️ (Machine). In this way, you can generate a total of six different reactions. These are:

<ul>
    <li>🔥 + ❄️ = 💧 (Water)</li>
    <li>🔥 + 🍃 = ♨💨 (Heat Wave)</li>
    <li>🔥 + ⚙️ = 💥 (Explosion)</li>
    <li>❄️ + 🍃 = 🌨️ (Blizzard)</li>
    <li>❄️ + ⚙️ = ☃️🤖 (Snowbot)</li>
    <li>⚙️ + 🍃 = 🌀 (Hurricane)</li>
</ul>

They all have weaknesses to other reactions, so you have to be careful with your elections. Althought you are not safe even if you choose the correct one, you are going to receive damage in any turn, but this will be higher or lower in base of the weaknesses of that reaction. You can check all advantages and weaknesses, as well as the percentages of life you would lost or cause in this table: 

<table style="align: center">
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>💧</td>
        <td>♨💨</td>
        <td>💥</td>
        <td>🌨️</td>
        <td>☃️🤖</td>
