Have you ever played rock-paper-scissors before? Are you tired of picking always the same three options? This is probably your game. Let's react! ✅

In this game you have differents reactions to beat your opponents, and you are probably wondering: Why are you always talking about reactions? What do you mean?

In order to fight you need to combine four main elements in pairs: ❄️ (Ice), 🔥 (Fire), 🍃 (Wind), and ⚙️ (Machine). In this way, you can generate a total of six different reactions. These are:

<ul>
    <li>🔥 + ❄️ = 💧 (Water)<li>
    <li>🔥 + 🍃 = ♨💨 (Heat Wave)</li>
    <li>🔥 + ⚙️ = 💥 (Explosion)</li>
    <li>❄️ + ⚙️ = ☃️🤖 (Snowbot)</li>
    <li>⚙️ + 🍃 = 🌀 (Hurricane)</li>
</ul>
