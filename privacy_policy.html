    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
    <p>
      This game was developed by Javier Alarcón as a free application. In this
      way, every person who download this software is able to enjoy it at no
      cost. As you can see, this page is used to inform about my policies with
      the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. If you decide
      to use my software, you are agreeing to the collection and utilisation of
      information in relation to this policy. All the data utilised will not
      shared with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy and will be
      always used to provide and improve your experience.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
    <p>
      All the data collected will be only always in your device storage and
      won't be shared with others or third-party services. It is utilised to
      remember options that you have selected previously, and for nothing else.
      For example, if you have played the last time easy mode, and you close
      the app. The next time, your game will be in the same difficulty. In
      order, to provide you an excellent offline experience, the first time that
      you play my game, the necessary resources will be loaded in the cache. This
      is a Progressive Web App (PWA), that works through your browser, so you
      only need to restore your usual browser data.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
      anonymous unique identifiers and they only stored in your device's
      internal memory. This software doesn't use Cookies, however, this page is
      hosted on Github and they may ask you if they can storage this data on
      your device, but you shouldn't be worried about this because this will
      just improve your experience and you may have not access to some parts of
      the app if you refuse to accept them.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>
      I value your trust in providing us your personal information, thus we are
      striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But
      remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of
      electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
    <p>
      This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
      third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
      external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
      review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and
      assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices
      of any third-party sites or services.

    <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
    <div>
      <p>
        The contents of this software are not suitable under the age of 13, and
        in this way, I don't collect personally identifiable information from
        children under this age. These Services do not address anyone under the
        age of 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me
        with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers.
        If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has
        provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will
        be able to do the necessary actions.
      </p>
